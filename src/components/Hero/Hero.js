          <p>
            I'm a software engineer who first started dabbling in web
            development in the early 2000s, teaching myself HTML and CSS, before
            going on to learn JavaScript and various frameworks and libraries
            such as React, Node, and Express. I'm passionate about open-source
            development, and have contributed to several projects over the
            years. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn!
          </p>
